In expressions involving numeric and string values with the + operator, JavaScript converts numeric values to strings. For example, consider the following statements:
```
x = "The answer is " + 42 // "The answer is 42"
y = 42 + " is the answer" // "42 is the answer"
```

In statements involving other operators, JavaScript does not convert numeric values to strings. For example:
```
"37" - 7 // 30
"37" + 7 // "377"
```
